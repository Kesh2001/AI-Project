## Job Vacancy Prediction using Sentiment Analysis of Immigration Policies
This project predicts job vacancies and unemployment rates in Ontario using a SARIMAX-based predictive model. The model incorporates sentiment analysis of immigration policies to enhance forecasting accuracy, achieving an 8-9% improvement. Key features include:

- Data Management: Built a relational database in PostgreSQL to store and manage labor market data.
- Visualization: Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze trends and present insights.
- Sentiment Analysis: Used IBM Watson to evaluate the impact of immigration policy changes on job markets.
- Innovation: Combines traditional statistical modeling with sentiment-driven insights for actionable predictions.

This project serves as a comprehensive approach to labor market analysis by integrating data analytics, machine learning, and sentiment analysis.
